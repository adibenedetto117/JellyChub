- NEVER PUSH CODE without me telling you its okay to do that. If you do get the okay then you must never include anymetion of claude code or AI every. Simple commits such as Added: etco or Fix: etc
- NEver add descriptions for commits
- When coding never add comments they take up too many tokens. Never add emojis ever. Follow the coding style. Think about the future when buildnig.
